Algorithm for Topological Sorting:
Prerequisite: DFS

We can modify DFS to find the Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS,
We start from a vertex, we first print it, and then
Recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
In topological sorting,
We use a temporary stack.
We don’t print the vertex immediately,
we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
Finally, print the contents of the stack.
Note: A vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack.

Approach:

1. Create a stack to store the nodes.
2. Initialize visited array of size N to keep the record of visited nodes.
3. Run a loop from 0 till N
4. if the node is not marked True in visited array
5. Call the recursive function for topological sort and perform the following steps.
6. Mark the current node as True in the visited array.
7. Run a loop on all the nodes which has a directed edge to the current node
8. if the node is not marked True in the visited array:
9. Recursively call the topological sort function on the node
10.Push the current node in the stack.
11.Print all the elements in the stack.

/* Time Complexity: O(V+E). The above algorithm is simply DFS with an extra stack. So time complexity is the same as DFS
Auxiliary space: O(V). The extra space is needed for the stack

Note: Here, we can also use a vector instead of the stack. If the vector is used then print the elements in reverse order to get the topological sorting.*/
